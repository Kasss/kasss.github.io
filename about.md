My name Kassen Dauren. I was born, grew and grow in Kazakhstan, Almaty. This my simple achievements and portfolio, not enough, but I am working on it and try my best. Have enough skills to do the given job, but not enough to me. So about me, briefly about childhood:  

  - from early childhood, I was never motivated and goal oriented person, even when spent 2-years in judo by instruction of my father.
  - even when family decided to give me to lyceum for gifted children (who I was not), I was the person which decisions was made by parents.
  - I was more dreamer that the person who realizing his dreams.

Everything changed when I have visited my future university at the end of school year. Since, I find my goal and motivation. I understood that my life will be connected with IT.

Nowadays workin' in studio, developing applications and keep growing. So, since and now:

  - never stopped dreaming, but instead of just dreaming making it goal to reach it.
  - find out that when you have money it is good, but when work is fun it's even better.
  - looking to apply my knowledge and keep acquiring new experiences [no pain no gain]
